          I’m a person who often try to absorb the new trends, rules, and regulations to stay a step ahead of it or think about what it could transform into. When I have created a clear goal in my mind, motivation comes naturally and to create plans of actions on how to achieve them. My interpersonal skill is also one of my assets, in every situation I try to be as clear cut as possibly can and make the best possible decision with a given time frame.
